# TOPS - Tooling for Operations

This will try to be a docker with the main utils that I use to need in my daily tasks.
It will be a continuously WIP.

To generate the executable you just need to run ```./argbash-generator```. In order to generate the bash script, I'm
using [Argbash](https://argbash.io/).
